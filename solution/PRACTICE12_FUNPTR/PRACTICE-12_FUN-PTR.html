<h1>PRACTICE-12_FUN-PTR</h1><h2>Circular Queue (p1v1d1)</h2><hr>Queues are very widely used in Computer Science (see week 10 lab problems Tuesday problem 1 and Thursday problem 1 - please understand those questions before solving this question). However, when implementing queues using arrays, managing the limited memory available becomes an issue. Suppose we have an array of size 5 and wish to implement a queue using this array.<br />
<br />
Suppose the operations given to us are (E = enqueue, D = dequeue, X = terminate)<br />
E 1<br />
E 2<br />
E 3<br />
E 4<br />
E 5<br />
D<br />
D<br />
Initially the array is empty (* denotes an empty location)<br />
[* * * * *]<br />
Then after the five enqueue operations, the array looks like<br />
[1 2 3 4 5]<br />
whereas after the next two dequeue operations, the array looks like<br />
[* * 3 4 5]<br />
the first two positions are no longer a part of the queue. Now if there are two more enqueue operations<br />
E 6<br />
E 7<br />
then we have a problem in our hands. There is no more space to the right of the array (new elements in the queue always go to the back of the queue) so we can do either of the following three things<br />
<ol><br />
<li>Refuse to enqueue the two new elements: although simple, this is a waste of space since there are two empty locations in the array<br />
<li>Shift the array to fill up the empty spaces: shift all entries two locations left so that the array looks like<br />
[3 4 5 * *]<br />
Now there is space to enqueue 6 and 7. However, this shifting business can take up a lot of time (imagine a queue with 3 million entries)<br />
<li>Reuse the space to the left using a circular queue: this is what we will implement in this question.<br />
</ol><br />
A circular queue is very efficient in reusing space in that it cycles around if the array has no more space to the right. Thus, in a circular queue, E 6 would result in<br />
[6 * 3 4 5]<br />
and then E 7 would result in<br />
[6 7 3 4 5]<br />
If we now see a D instruction, we would pop 3 and the array pop an element from the front of the queue which is the element 3, and the array would look like<br />
[6 7 * 4 5]<br />
If we see 3 more D instructions, elements would keep getting popped from the front of the queue and the array would look like<br />
[6 7 * * 5]<br />
[6 7 * * *]<br />
[* 7 * * *]<br />
If we now see the instruction E 8, the array will get added to the back of the queue<br />
[* 7 8 * *]<br />
If we pop two elements now, the array would become all empty again<br />
[* * * * *]<br />
If we add a new element now E 9, it would get added to the back of the queue which gets reset to the first element of the array<br />
[9 * * * *]<br />
Remember, dequeuing from an empty queue results in an "UNDERFLOW" error and enqueuing to an already full queue results in an "OVERFLOW" error.<br />
<br />
You have to implement enqueue and dequeue operations in a circular queue as described above and print the state of the array after every operation (or else print the error message). The first line of the input will tell you the size of the array you should use.<h3>Visible Test Cases</h3><table border = "1"><tr><th>Input</th><th>Output</th><tr><td>5<br />

<br />
You will be given a positive number n and then n positive integers. Store these numbers in an array arr. As your output, you have to print n numbers where ith number is arr[i-1]*(sum of all primes strictly less than arr[i-1]) where i runs from 1 to n. For this problem, 0 and 1 are not considered primes.<br />

However, C functions can call themselves as well. The process of a function calling itself is called recursion and it can be used to write very elegant solutions to complex-looking problems.<br />
<br />
The template code given with this problem gives you the recursive code to print the locations of all occurrences of a given character in a string. Modify this code to print all occurrences of a given substring in a string. Both the string, as well as the substring will be at most 99 characters long and will be given in a single line. We will first give the substring then the string in two separate lines.<br />
<br />
WARNING: programs that use recursion excessively can be slow due to the cloning process being a bit expensive. All C programs that are written using recursion, can also be written in a way that does not use any recursion. This result is a landmark and fundamental result in the theory of computation (CSE students will study this topic in the course CS340), guaranteed by the Church-Turing thesis. However, the non-recursive code can sometimes look very messy to humans whereas the recursive code looked very elegant, even though the messy code is faster than the elegant code.<br />
<br />
The template code is reproduced below in case you erase it while coding.<br />
